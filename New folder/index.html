			 <h3>How it spreads</h3>
             <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets<br> 
             	generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets<br>
             	 are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.</p>

			 <p>Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the<br>
			  mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined<br>
			   with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local<br>
			    health authority.</p>
